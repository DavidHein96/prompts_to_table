We want the diagnosis of the current report at hand. Make sure to capture any text that mentions whether tissue specimens are benign, malignant, free of carcinoma, or have a histology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). \n We are also very interested in whether metastatic RCC is present so make sure to capture any text referencing metastatic RCC. Additionally make note of any laterality (left vs right) if it is mentioned. Metastatic RCC is defined as renal cell carcinoma (any subtype) that has spread outside of the kidney. We want to capture the location it has spread to as well. There may be multiple metastatic sites (bone, liver, lung, brain etc.). Direct extension of a primary kidney tumor into nearby organs does not constitute metastasis. \n We are also interested in the presence of regional lymph node metastasis, so ensure that if RCC is present in lymph nodes that the lymph node location is captured. RCC in Hilar, Precaval, Interaortocaval, Paracaval, Retrocaval, Preaortic, Paraaortic, Retroaortic or Retroperitoneal lymph-nodes would be considered regional lymph node metastasis. RCC in lymph nodes not listed would be considered a distant metastasis. \n Renal oncocytoma and angiomyolipoma are considered Benign neoplasm of kidney. \n Low grade oncocytic tumors of the kidney and renal oncocytic neoplasm are considered Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of kidney. There may be addendum to reports that confirms or denies a potential diagnosis, ensure these are captured and commented on in your reasoning. \n Additionally, there may be an addendum with follow up tests (typically immunohistochemistry IHC) that may confirm or deny a diagnosis, ensure that these are captured.",

If RCC is only in the kidney, diagnose as 'Malignant neoplasm of left kidney, except renal pelvis' or 'Malignant neoplasm of right kidney, except renal pelvis', depending on the affected kidney (if specified). If a biopsy from another site like the lung is negative for carcinoma, it's not metastatic RCC. \n If there is confirmed RCC that has only spread to regional lymph nodes- hilar, Precaval, Interaortocaval, Paracaval, Retrocaval, Preaortic, Paraaortic, Retroaortic, reteroperitoneal- diagnose as RCC with regional lymph node metastasis. This diagnosis should only be used when RCC has only spread to the listed lymph nodes. If RCC is confirmed in a lymph node not in this list, diagnose as Metastatic RCC. Direct extension of a primary kidney tumor into nearby organs does not constitute metastasis. \n If all tissues are benign or negative for carcinoma, the diagnosis should reflect this as benign or as specified in the report. Prioritize the primary diagnosis based on current findings, only diagnosing metastatic RCC if RCC is confirmed outside the kidney. Use 'Other-<specific diagnosis>' if unsure, focusing solely on current findings and disregarding medical history unless directly relevant. \n 'Renal oncocytoma' and 'angiomyolipoma' are considered 'Benign neoplasm of kidney'. Alternatively, Low grade oncocytic tumors of the kidney and renal oncocytic neoplasm are considered Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of kidney. \n There may be an addendum captured that contains test results (typically immunohistochemistry or IHC) that confirm or deny a diagnosis, in these cases reflect on the addendum and how it informed your chosen diagnosis."

In the case that there is no renal cell carcinoma in the entire report please return the special label 'NO RCC'. Finally, note on whether the pathologist has indicated that there is still some uncertainity in the staging or histolgical diagnosis. If this uncertainity is not resolved in addendums, please append the special label 'UNCERTAIN' to the TNM staging. This label should be used in instances where the pathologist is not certain that tissue is renal cell carcinoma. This label should NOT be used when the pathologist is uncertain or unclear about the renal cell carcinoma subtype.

Otherwise, attempt to capture all important sites if they are present and report them separated with semicolons. \n Please do not include extra information about the kidney pole i.e. upper pole, lower pole, etc. If the site is not listed, return 'Other- <fill in as per report>' and fill in the specific site as per the report. \n Try to capture the site at the level of granularity of the provided list. For example, if the site is cerebellum in the text, return 'Brain', as the cerebellum is part of the brain, if the site is pericardium in the text, return heart etc. Similarly, a renal cyst would be one of the 'Kidney' options. When capturing a site at a less detailed level of granularity, ensure that you explain your reasoning and reflect on how you came to the conclusion, think about how you would explain it to a fifth grader. \n Analyze whether there are any position or direction terms that are relevant, for example a 'peripancreatic mass' would not be captured as 'Pancreas' as this refers to a mass in the tissue surrounding the pancreas. For this example the correct label would be 'Other- peripancreatic mass'. Reflect on any of these potential distinctions in the reasoning section. Remember To use alphabetical order for multiple sites, standardizing to the provided list and using the first letter of each site. \n IMPORTANT: The histology of a specimen is not typically informative of its anatomical site, for example renal cell carcinoma that has metastasized to the left lung would ONLY have the anatomical site 'Lung, left' if the specimen ONLY contains lung tissue."

For Ki-67, replace <% as per report> with the proliferative index as a percent. Make note of if these tests were successful or if you need to use the non contributory label. For these tests there should ONLY be the SINGLE status label with the % or non contributory \n Before using the Other- option, ensure that the test name has no good matches to the standardized list and is not in the list of synonyms. \n When you see the result 'Intact (Positive nuclear staining ...)' favor returning only the result 'Intact', no other qualifiers are needed. Only do this if BOTH the words Intact AND Positive are used together to describe the result for the same test. Similarly, when you see the results 'Negative (loss ...)' favor returning only the result 'Loss'. Only do this if BOTH the words negative AND loss are used together to describe the result for the same test.

And report text 'positive patchy membranous staining' would become 'Positive, patchy membranous'. \n Note that for tests like CA-IX the 'complete circumferential (box-like)' and 'basal lateral membranous (cup-like)' patterns are subtypes of the membranous pattern, and the more specific FULL term should be used when available. \n Ensure that if there are no good matches for a test name and it is not in the list of synonyms, that you use the 'Other-' tag and fill in the specific test name as per the report. Ensure that you use the correct grammar for the result, as provided in the standardized list. Make a note in your reasoning section if there are any standardizations that need to be made, for example, if in the text the pathologist wrote 'focally positive' this would be standardized to 'Positive, focal'. \n IMPORTANT: You should always standardize spelling to EXACTLY the way it is provided in the list of standardized terms. For example, the result 'diffusely' should always be standardized to 'diffuse' in your output. Use the standardized spelling in your reasoning section. \n REMINDER: Each test should only have one standardized result from the status section. Favor the terms 'Intact' or 'Retained'  or one of the other options over Positive when BOTH are present. Favor 'Loss' or 'No evidence of rearrangement' over Negative when BOTH are present.
