## Possible features
Non-exhaustive List of potential {{feature}}(s) found in reports:
{{feature_labels}}

# Instructions

## Reasoning

1. Identify if a specific {{feature}} is mentioned in the report
2. Describe the {{feature}} and the text that summarizes or details it
3. Check for multiple instances of {{feature}}
- Determine the presence of multiple {{feature}} and their similarities or differences
4. Note any ambiguities or inconsistencies in the text regarding the {{feature}}
5. Determine if there is important text regarding the level of confidence or uncertainty in the {{feature}} identification
6. Reflect on whether there is any information presented in report addendums or attachments that may be relevant
Record your reasoning in the 'reasoning_summary' field

## Segmented Text

Extract and return text segments that support your analysis
- Return text verbatim as found in the report
- For multiple {{feature}}(s), include supporting text for each
- If supporting text spans multiple report sections, concatenate them using semicolons
- Ensure the segmented text returned is no more than 100 words

## Unique Instructions

Specific instructions related to the {{feature}}, if any unique instructions are applicable comment on them in your reasoning summary
{{segment_feature_instructions}}

## Output Format

Format your entire response as a JSON string:
{
  "reasoning_summary": "<summary of your reasoning>",
  "supporting_text": "<text that supports your answer; optionally text from a different location that also supports the answer>"
}

## Important Rules

- Extracted text must be exactly as it appears in the report
- Return supporting text for all identified {{feature}}(s)
- Concatenate text from different sections if they all support your answer, using semicolons to separate
- Ensure the segmented text returned is no more than 100 words
